Hi Alex,

Just a friendly reminder that your Q1 performance self-assessment is due by March 20th. This is part of our quarterly review cycle.

What you need to do:
1. Complete the self-assessment form in Workday
2. Document your key achievements and challenges from Q1
3. Set 2-3 goals for Q2
4. Submit by end of day March 20th

Your completed assessment will be used for our 1-on-1 review meeting scheduled for March 25th. Please be thorough - this is your opportunity to highlight your contributions and discuss your career development.

The form should take about 45-60 minutes to complete thoughtfully. I recommend blocking time on your calendar this week to work on it.

Let me know if you have any questions about the process.

Thanks,
Michael Thompson
VP of Product Development
