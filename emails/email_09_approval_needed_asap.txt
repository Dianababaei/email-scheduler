Michael and Sarah,

I need urgent approval for a cloud infrastructure budget increase before tomorrow's vendor renewal deadline. Our current AWS contract expires Friday and we need to commit to the new tier by EOD Thursday.

Situation:
- Current monthly spend: $45K
- Projected need based on user growth: $68K/month
- Annual commitment required for 15% discount: $816K
- Current approved budget: $540K annually

Request:
- Approve additional $276K for annual cloud infrastructure budget
- Authorization needed from both of you as co-approvers per finance policy

Justification:
- User base has grown 40% since last year's budget planning
- Without upgrade, we'll face service degradation and potential outages
- The 15% discount saves us $144K compared to month-to-month pricing
- Delay risks losing the discount pricing and negotiating leverage

I've attached the detailed cost analysis and vendor proposal. This is time-sensitive - please review and approve ASAP so I can finalize the contract tomorrow morning.

Can you both reply with approval by end of day today?

Thanks,
David Kim
DevOps Lead
