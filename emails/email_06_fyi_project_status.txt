Hey team,

Just a quick FYI that the database infrastructure upgrade we've been working on is now complete. Everything went smoothly over the maintenance window last night.

Summary:
- PostgreSQL upgraded to version 15.2
- Query performance improvements: 20-30% faster on average
- New monitoring dashboards available in Grafana
- No action required from your side

The upgrade was transparent to all applications. You might notice improved response times in your development environments.

Documentation has been updated in the wiki when you have time to review it. Feel free to reach out if you notice anything unusual, but everything should be working normally.

Cheers,
David Kim
DevOps Lead
