Subject: DECISION REQUIRED: Cloud Migration Strategy - Response Needed by Friday
Date: Monday, January 15, 2024, 3:15 PM
Priority: High

Team,

We're at a critical juncture with our infrastructure planning and need to make a decision on our cloud migration strategy by this Friday, January 19th at 5 PM. The vendor contracts need to be signed next week to meet our Q2 migration timeline.

BACKGROUND:
After three months of evaluation, we've narrowed down to two options:

Option A: AWS Multi-Region Setup
- Estimated cost: $180K annually
- Migration time: 4 months
- Better disaster recovery
- Steeper learning curve for the team

Option B: Google Cloud Platform
- Estimated cost: $145K annually  
- Migration time: 3 months
- Easier integration with our current tools
- Single region deployment (can expand later)

STAKEHOLDER INPUT NEEDED:

Rachel, as CFO, I need your budget approval and preference based on the financial analysis. Please provide your recommendation by Wednesday EOD considering both CapEx and OpEx implications.

Tom, from an engineering perspective, which platform better supports our technical requirements? Your team will be managing this long-term, so your input on operational overhead is crucial. Please send your technical assessment by Thursday morning.

Patricia, what are the compliance implications for each option given our healthcare clients? We need to ensure HIPAA compliance. Please confirm both options meet our regulatory requirements by Wednesday.

James, as VP of Engineering, please coordinate with your team leads and provide the final technical recommendation. We need this by Thursday 3 PM to make an informed decision.

DECISION TIMELINE:
- Wednesday EOD: Financial and compliance input
- Thursday 3 PM: Technical recommendations
- Friday 2 PM: Final decision meeting (all stakeholders required)
- Friday 5 PM: Decision documented and communicated

POST-DECISION ACTION ITEMS:

Once we decide, the following needs to happen immediately:

Sarah, you'll need to draft the vendor contracts and send them for legal review by Monday, January 22nd.

Marcus, please prepare the migration project plan with detailed phases and resource allocation. This should be ready for review by January 24th.

Tom, your team needs to set up the POC environment within one week of the decision to validate our architecture.

This decision impacts our ability to scale in Q2, so please treat this as top priority. If you have concerns or need additional information, please respond to this email or call me directly.

Thank you,
