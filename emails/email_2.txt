Subject: Code Review Request: Authentication Module Refactoring
Date: Wednesday, January 17, 2024, 11:20 AM

Hi Emma,

I've completed the authentication module refactoring that we discussed during last sprint's retrospective. The code is ready for review and I'd appreciate your expertise on the security implementation.

PR Link: https://github.com/devstudio/auth-refactor/pull/847

WHAT'S CHANGED:
- Migrated from JWT to OAuth 2.0 flow
- Implemented refresh token rotation
- Added rate limiting on login endpoints
- Updated password hashing to use Argon2

REVIEW FOCUS AREAS:
I'd especially like your feedback on:
1. The token refresh mechanism (lines 145-203)
2. Error handling in the middleware (lines 89-112)
3. Security test coverage

Emma, could you review this by next Tuesday, January 23rd? I know it's a decent amount of code (~450 lines changed), so please let me know if you need more time.

FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS:

After your review, I'll need to:
- Address any security concerns you identify
- Update the API documentation to reflect the new auth flow
- Schedule a knowledge transfer session with the backend team

Carlos, once Emma approves the changes, can you schedule the deployment to staging environment? We should test this thoroughly before the January 30th production release.

Emma, please also add any other reviewers you think should weigh in on the security aspects. Better safe than sorry with authentication changes.

Thanks for your help on this!

Best,
Alex Thompson
