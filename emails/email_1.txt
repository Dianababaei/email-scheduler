Subject: URGENT: Q1 Product Roadmap Review Meeting - This Thursday
Date: Monday, January 15, 2024, 9:45 AM

Hi team,

We need to finalize our Q1 product roadmap before the executive presentation on Friday. I'm scheduling an emergency strategy meeting for this Thursday, January 18th, at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B.

This is a critical meeting as the exec team needs our finalized roadmap by EOD Friday.

AGENDA:
1. Review proposed features for Q1 release
2. Finalize resource allocation
3. Identify and mitigate risks
4. Set milestone dates

ACTION ITEMS BEFORE THE MEETING:

Sarah, can you please prepare the competitive analysis slides covering our top 3 competitors? We need this by Wednesday EOD to review before the meeting.

Michael, I need you to validate the technical feasibility of the mobile app features we discussed last week. Please send your assessment by Wednesday 5 PM so we can adjust the roadmap if needed.

David, please confirm attendance from all stakeholders (Engineering, Design, Marketing leads) by end of day today. We cannot proceed without full team representation.

Lisa, can you update the project timeline spreadsheet with the latest dependencies? This needs to be shared with the team by tomorrow (Tuesday) morning so everyone can review before the meeting.

Meeting attendance is mandatory. If you absolutely cannot attend, please notify me immediately and arrange for your lead to represent your team.

Looking forward to a productive session.

Best regards,
Jennifer Martinez
Senior Product Manager
TechCorp Inc.
