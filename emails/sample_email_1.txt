Subject: Q4 Project Deadline Reminder

Hi Team,

I wanted to send a quick reminder that the Q4 project deliverables are due by December 15th, 2024. This includes:

1. Final project reports
2. Budget reconciliation documents
3. Performance metrics dashboard

Please ensure all your reports are submitted to the shared drive by EOD December 14th. If you have any blockers or concerns that might prevent you from meeting this deadline, please reach out to me immediately so we can discuss solutions.

Additionally, we need to schedule a final review meeting before the submission. I'll send out a meeting invite for December 13th.

Thanks for your hard work on this project!

Best regards,
John Smith
Project Manager
