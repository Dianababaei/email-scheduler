Hey Alex,

Hope you're doing well! When you get a chance, could you review my PR for the new analytics dashboard feature? No rush on this - I know you're swamped this week.

PR Details:
- Link: https://github.com/techcorp/portal/pull/847
- Changes: ~450 lines across 8 files
- Main components: Dashboard layout, chart widgets, data fetching hooks

What I'd appreciate feedback on:
- Overall architecture approach
- Any performance concerns with the data refresh logic
- Accessibility of the chart components
- General code quality and test coverage

This isn't blocking anything urgent - it's for the Q2 feature set. I'm planning to merge early next week after incorporating feedback, so whenever you can take a look in the next few days would be great.

Feel free to ping me if anything needs clarification. Thanks in advance!

Best,
Jessica
Software Engineer
