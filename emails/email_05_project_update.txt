Hi everyone,

Here's this week's progress update on the customer portal redesign project.

Progress This Week:
- Completed user research interviews (12/12 done)
- Finalized wireframes for dashboard and settings pages
- Started high-fidelity mockups for the main navigation
- Alex began API endpoint development for new dashboard widgets

Blockers:
- Waiting on legal review for new terms of service language
- Design system color palette needs final approval from brand team

Next Steps:
- Complete all high-fidelity designs by March 15
- Alex and Maria to begin development sprint planning
- Schedule stakeholder review session for next Friday

The team (Alex, Maria, and I) will sync Monday morning to align on priorities for next week.

Overall we're on track for the end-of-month milestone. Let me know if you have any questions.

Have a great weekend!

Robert Santos
