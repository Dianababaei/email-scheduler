Hi everyone,

Just wanted to let you know we're hosting an informal brown bag lunch session next week on AI development tools. No rush to RSVP - this is completely optional and casual.

Details:
- Topic: Exploring GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants
- When: Next Thursday around lunch time
- Where: Kitchen area
- Bring your own lunch

I'll do a quick 15-minute demo and then open it up for discussion. Would love to hear about any tools you've been experimenting with.

Feel free to drop by when you can. No pressure if you're busy!

Cheers,
Lisa
Senior Developer
